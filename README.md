#### Building the source

The source can be built from the rake task `rake build` or using visual studio. If using rake, ensure `albacore`
and `version_bumper` gems are installed. Rename `rakefile.config.example.rb` to `rakefile.config.rb`. 

For running tests, ensure to rename `AppSettings.example.config` to `AppSettings.config` and 
set your own Api Key in the test project. Tests can be executed from rake: `rake test` or from any nunit test runner
tool.
